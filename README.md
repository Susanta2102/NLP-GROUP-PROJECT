# Security Policy and Compliance Automation Using NLP

## Project Overview
This project focuses on automating the extraction and enforcement of security policies and compliance requirements from regulatory documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The tool uses advanced NLP techniques to identify, categorize, and check compliance with security policies, particularly for frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. The goal is to develop an automated solution to assess compliance, extract relevant information, and enforce security and privacy standards.

## Objectives
- To develop a method for extracting relevant information from privacy policy texts.
- To apply NLP models to classify text according to GDPR compliance criteria.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of different NLP models in identifying GDPR principles.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
To run the project, you will need the following software:
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **spaCy**
- **Transformers**
- **NLTK**
- **Compliance Libraries** (for regulatory documents)

### Setup
To set up the project on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone<https://github.com/Susanta2102/NLP-GROUP-PROJECT>
   cd NLP-GROUP-PROJECT
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
To run the GDPR compliance checker, execute:  

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then you can open the corresponding `your_policy_text file.html` in any browser of your choice and view the report!
